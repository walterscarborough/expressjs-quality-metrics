    "body": "Hey guys,\r\nI think it would be nice to be able to set options to single Routes. For example one can set a default layout for the handlebars rendering engine with \r\n```javascript\r\napp.set('view options', { layout: 'main' });\r\n```\r\nor with \r\n```javascript\r\napp.engine(\".hbs\", handlebars({\r\n\tdefaultLayout: \"main\", \r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using a ``express.Router()`` for example with ``app.use(\"/admin\", adminRouter)`` it would be nice to be able to use something like\r\n```javascript\r\nadminRouter.set('view options', { layout: 'adminMain' });\r\n```\r\nto prevent using \r\n```javascript\r\nres.render('home', {layout: \"adminMain\"});\r\n```\r\nfor every call to ``res.render``\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n-André-"

At some point about middle of it, the same request is fired again, before the first one is finished. It's not a browser issue, both Chrome and Firefox behave exactly the same, and Fiddler doesn't list a second request. This is the route :\r\n```\r\nrouter.get('/mig', function (req, res) {\r\n    console.log(\"MIGRATION REQUESTED\");\r\n    mig.run().then(function () {\r\n        res.send(\"Done\");\r\n    }).catch(function (cause) {\r\n        res.send(\"Failed for \" + cause.message);\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso there is a global middleware, registered as first middleware, just logs requests to the console. This is also fired twice.\r\n```\r\napp.use(function (req, res, next) {\r\n    console.log(\"NEW REQUEST \" + req.url);\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\nAnd HTTP log records.

    "body": "At the moment, when the developer provides a route path containing raw characters that must escaped by HTTP clients, for example a space character, the route is registered by express even though it will never match any request (URL):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar app = express();\r\napp.get('/foo bar', function(req, res) { /* ... */ });\r\n\r\n// clients send `GET /foo%20bar`, server responds with 404\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuch situation is difficult to troubleshoot, especially if the invalid character was included by mistake.\r\n\r\nI am proposing to modify Express and/or path-to-regexp to print a warning when a string path argument contains characters that will be always sent in the encoded form by HTTP clients. [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2) allows some characters to be sent either encoded or unencoded. Such characters should be accepted as valid (no error/warning).\r\n\r\nIn other words, only the following characters may be present in the unencoded form:\r\n\r\n - Unreserved characters: `ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\"`\r\n - Reserved characters: `\":\" / \"/\" / \"?\" / \"#\" / \"[\" / \"]\" / \"@\" / \"!\" / \"$\" / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"(\" / \")\" / \"*\" / \"+\" / \",\" / \";\" / \"=\"`\r\n\r\n@dougwilson thoughts? StrongLoop can contribute the change, I just want to check with you that such change will be accepted.\r\n\r\nI was initially thinking that express should throw an error instead of printing a warning, but since such change may be considered as breaking backwards compatibility, it's probably better to stay with the warning.\r\n\r\n/cc @PradnyaBaviskar"

    "body": "Hi,\r\nI am currently facing a problem with a route which lets users download files. The filename and the hash of the file are first queried from a database and then used in the `res.download` method to let the user download the file.\r\n\r\nIt is possible however, that under the same route, the file might change. That's because a file in my app has an id and the file can be changed afterwards (for example a new revision). The problem I am facing is, that Google Chrome will get an ERR_INVALID_RESPONSE error when the file behind the logic changes. It works however fine with Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nThis is the route's code:\r\n```\r\n// download document\r\nrouter.get('/dl/:id', function(req, res){\r\n\t\r\n\t// TODO: check permissions\r\n\tvar id = req.param('id');\r\n\tvar sql = req.sql;\r\n\tvar hash;\r\n\tvar filename;\r\n\r\n\tvar ddq = new sql.Request();\r\n\tddq.stream = true;\r\n\tddq.input('documentID', sql.Int, id);\r\n\tddq.execute('getDocumentDataForDownload');\r\n\tddq.on('row', function(row){\r\n\t\thash = row.document_hash;\r\n\t\tfilename = row.document_real_name;\r\n\t\tconsole.log(hash);\r\n\t\tconsole.log(filename);\r\n\t});\r\n\tddq.on('done', function(v){\r\n\t\tres.download('./fs/' + hash, filename, function(err){\r\n\t\t\tif(err){\r\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log(err);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpress Version 4.11\r\n\r\nAny ideas what could cause this problem?"

    "body": "I'm really sorry if this is a super newbie question but I've been beating my head against the wall with it for a few hours. \r\n\r\nI noticed in your tests you're constantly creating a new app = express(). How do you manage this without things such as routes created in previous tests polluting your working app instance?\r\n\r\nBackground: I wrote a little framework on top of express (https://github.com/jackspaniel/yukon) and I am trying to test different config options. This includes different routes being registered for different config. The problem is that I always seem to have the same express instance of express in my test, so that I have routes from config A and routes from config B (also a lot more config options are getting mixed together). \r\n\r\nSo far the only way I've gotten the problem to go away away is if I split my tests into separate processes. This works but I don't get accurate test coverage. I'm sure you don't run every test in a separate process so I'm wondering how you manage to create a fresh express instance every time.\r\n\r\nMy testfile:\r\n```js\r\nvar express = require('express');\r\nvar bodyParser = require('body-parser');\r\nvar demoApp = require('../demo/demoApp');\r\nvar altDemoApp = require('../demo/altDemoApp');\r\n\r\ndescribe('demoApp/yukon component framework test suite', function(){\r\n  it('should register all routes for main app', function(done){  \r\n    var app = express();\r\n    app.use(bodyParser.json());\r\n    demoApp(app, {debugToConsole: false}); // requires yukon, which initializes express routes among other things\r\n   \r\n    // test some routes\r\n\r\n    done();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n\r\ndescribe('alt demoApp test suite - for stuff like optional components', function(){\r\n  it('should register all routes for alt app', function(done){\r\n    var app = express();\r\n    app.use(bodyParser.json());\r\n    \r\n    // this is where the problem happens - altDemoApp registers some routes and sets the yukon config\r\n    // if I comment out the line below and associated tests, I see no debug to console output when I run make test\r\n    // but if I leave the altDemoApp and tests in, I always see all debug to console output for the whole suite of tests\r\n    // I also see all routes from both apps registered\r\n    altDemoApp(app, {debugToConsole: true}); // passes config object to yukon as second argument\r\n\r\n    // test some routes\r\n\r\n    done();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee my comments above.\r\n\r\nMy makefile:\r\n```test:\t\r\n\t@./node_modules/.bin/mocha --bail\\\r\n\t\ttest/yukon.test.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for any help you can give to point me in the right direction. I really appreciate it."
