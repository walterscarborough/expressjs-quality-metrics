    "body": "I discovered today that it seems params registered on `app` are not respected in routes registered via a router (`express.Router()`).  Perhaps I'm just missing something though!\r\n\r\nWhile sectioning an application's routes via routers is super handy, having to re-register shared params on each of them is not.\r\n\r\nA use case to consider: an application that has a page which renders user details in which the view needs the user data, and in addition the app exposes an API to get the raw JSON response for use by a client-side app, mobile app, or third party.\r\n\r\n``````````javascript\r\nvar express = require('express');\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\n// Shared Params\r\n\r\napp.param('user', function (req, res, next, id) {\r\n  req.user = { id: id, name: 'Fred' };\r\n  next();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Website\r\n\r\napp.get('/users/:user', function (req, res) {\r\n  res.render('user', req.user);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Application API (JSON Responses)\r\n\r\nvar APIRouter = express.Router();\r\n\r\nrouter.get('/users/:user', function (req, res) {\r\n  res.json(req.user); // req.user is undefined!\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.use('/api', APIRouter);\r\n\r\n// App Start\r\n\r\napp.listen(8000);\r\n````````\r\n\r\nSeems that shared params across application \"sections\" when using routers would be a very common scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMaybe this is going too far, but it'd make sense that any param registered on a parent router applied to its children, but possibly not visa-versa:\r\n\r\n``````javascript\r\nvar parent = express.Router();\r\nvar child = express.Router();\r\n\r\nparent.param('foo', function (req, res, next) {\r\n    req.foo = { ... };\r\n    next();\r\n});\r\n\r\nchild.param('bar', function (req, res, next) {\r\n    req.bar = { ... };\r\n    next();\r\n});\r\n\r\nparent.get('/:foo/:bar', function (req, res) {\r\n    res.json({\r\n        foo: req.foo, // OK!\r\n        bar: req.bar // undefined\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n\r\nchild.get('/:foo/:bar', function (req, res) {\r\n    res.json({\r\n        foo: req.foo, // OK!\r\n        bar: req.bar // OK!\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n\r\nparent.use(child);\r\n```````````\r\n\r\nThoughts/advice appreciated!"

My biggest gripe right now is that the special characters outside of a custom matching group restricts the characters that can be used inside of a matching group. I want to change this behaviour so only regex characters can be used inside a matching group and characters outside will be escaped.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n* `/test?` - currently valid, makes the `t` character optional which really look like a bug\r\n* `/:test(.*)` - currently invalid, periods are being escaped and asterisks are being turned into matching any character groups\r\n* `/(\\\\d+)` - currently won't be indexed properly since we don't have any regex group logic\r\n* `/\\\\*` - currently invalid, can't escape the meaning of special characters and will still become a match all route"

In this case, a 405 is the correct status code.\r\n\r\nThe previous issue was closed with a comment saying it is a matter of opinion, but I don't think it is, I think Express is currently not following the specification correctly, and it's currently up to developers to add code to conform properly. I think it is reasonable for developers to expect and assume that their framework will do this for them.\r\n\r\nSupport for this was added to 'express-subroute', but as this is an incorrect handling of the HTTP spec, the functionality for returning 405s should really be in Express core, and not rely on developers finding a separate package, and adding extra functionality with it that they don't need."

    "body": "When I read about [req.cookies] [1] in expressjs docs, it says\r\n\r\n> When the cookieParser() middleware is used this object defaults to {}, otherwise contains the cookies sent by the user-agent.\r\n\r\nAnd when I read about [CookieParser middleware] [2], it says\r\n\r\n> Parses the Cookie header field and populates req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names.\r\n\r\nSo, `req.cookies` says if I use CookieParser, it will be set to `{}`, but CookieParser says it will populate `req.cookies`. Sounds confusing to me.\r\n\r\nMy question is, why do we need CookieParser, if req.cookies itself gives the cookies? I asked [this question] [3] in stackoverflow also.\r\n\r\n   [1]: http://expressjs.com/api.html#req.cookies\r\n   [2]: http://expressjs.com/api.html#cookieParser\r\n   [3]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20550656/cookieparser-vs-req-cookies-expressjs"
