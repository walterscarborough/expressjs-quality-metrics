My [request.js](https://github.com/mikeal/request) based client was complaining that the JSON object couldn't be parsed with \"unexpected end of input\".\r\n\r\nAfter some sleuthing, here's what I know:\r\n* This problem does not appear to happen on OS/X, only on Ubuntu.\r\n* I modified the server side to call JSON.stringify() and then send the string, so I know the server is writing 12,497,131 bytes.  The client is rather consistently receiving 163,648 bytes.\r\n* If I try to connect to the server with CURL, I get the rather enigmatic error message: `curl: (18) transfer closed with 12333490 bytes remaining to read`\r\n\r\nAnyone know what's going on here?  I'll see if I can whip up a quick gist that demonstrates the problem."
