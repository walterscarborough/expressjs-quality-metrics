    "body": "I am using express.Router to build routes using Router.param() to preprocess a parameter and Router.get() to set the route path.\r\n\r\nWhen an array of paths is provided to the Router.get() call, all route paths exist and are executed, but only the last provided path in the array has the parameter appearing as expected.  For any other paths in the array, the parameter does not exist and Router.param() is not called.\r\n\r\nPer [API doc for app.use()](http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.use), an array of paths is acceptable, and the routes clearly exist and get called at every path provided - however the parameter is never extracted except in the last provided path.\r\n\r\nTo recreate, I created a base app using command line \"express\" tool. In the newly created routes/user.js, I added:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrouter.param('user', function(req, res, next, user_id) {\r\n\tres.write(\"PARAM CHECK look up user \" + user_id + \"\\n\");\r\n\treq.query.user_id = user_id;\r\n\tnext();\r\n});\r\n\r\nrouter.get('/:user', function(req, res, next) {\r\n\tres.end(\"GET USER \" + req.query.user_id + \"\\n\");\r\n});\r\n\r\nrouter.get('/:user/happy', function(req, res, next) {\r\n\tres.end(\"HAPPY USER \" + req.query.user_id + \"\\n\");\r\n});\r\n\r\nrouter.get(['/:user/sad', '/:user/glum', '/:user/morose'], function(req, res, next) {\r\n\tres.end(\"SAD USER \" + req.query.user_id + \"\\n\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nResults from the routes:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:3000/users/me/happy\r\nPARAM CHECK look up user me\r\nHAPPY USER me\r\n\r\ncurl http://localhost:3000/users/me/morose\r\nPARAM CHECK look up user me\r\nSAD USER me\r\n\r\ncurl http://localhost:3000/users/me/glum\r\nSAD USER undefined\r\n\r\ncurl http://localhost:3000/users/me/sad\r\nSAD USER undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nDumping req.params to the console on the failed calls returning \"undefined\", I see:\r\n`{ user: undefined }`.   The parameter was recognized as existing in the route path, but was never properly extracted within the routing mechanism.\r\n\r\n"
